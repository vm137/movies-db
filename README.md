## Task 6 (Routing)
Create routing for your application.  
Link app states between each other with React router.  
By default user lands on a new page with empty results state (caption 0).  

When user clicks on a film item, redirect him to: `localhost/film/id`  

Handle invalid URLs, display create a `404 page`, where user will be
redirected in case of invalid URL.  

On switching search type or sorting type you shouldnâ€™t switch any routes. 
When user performs a new search, you should redirect him to: `localhost/search/Search%20Query`
